# MacroNutrients:
## calorie:
heat needed to rise temperature of one gram of water by one degree celcius.
unit: calorie(cal)
food calorie/large calorie = 1000 calories. (when talking about foods we say calorie for kCal)
cal = heat/celcius=4.2joules.
empty calories:plain calories found in sodas, with no other nutritioanl value.
## protein  
* growth of muscles,bones,hair,skin,hormones,tissues(really important)
## fats    
* new cells,blood clotting,growth,muscle,brain function
### monoUnsaturated
* are good fats provide essential acids and fat-soluble vitamins.
### polyUnsaturated
Oily fish, corn oil, sesame oil, soya oil, and spreads made from those oils. Flaxseed, pine nuts, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and walnuts. sardines, flaxseeds, walnuts, canola oil, and unhydrogenated soybean oil.
### saturated
* stay solid at room temperature. 
Bad at too much amount, should be less than 10% of daily diet.can cause cholestrol and heart problem increase.
### transFat
* bad entirely, these are prepared by hydrogenation of oils, which increase the taste of food but are not good for heart and brain. these are called trans fats or hydrogenated fats.(used to preserve foods)
* raise (LDL) bad cholestrol, decrease (HDL) good cholestrol.
## carbohydrates   
* energy,brain,nervous system,digestive
fiber, starch,sugar 
### simpleCarbohydrates
* simplecarbs are easier to digest and faster to absorb to blood sugar,this will result in energy surge after eating then loose energy after a while making us feel hugry.
* carbs in bread,soda,candy are simple and are empty calories.
* if glucose is less in our body then,protein is consumed to make energy which is problematic(loss of muscle).
* this sudden blood glucose level increase is called glycemic index, foods with high glycemic index is not good for health 
### complexCarbohydrates    
* consume 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories.

## water 
* brain,physical,mental,cleaning,resistence     
* drink when thirsty, a good measure is to drink about 2 liters/day.

# physics:
**speed of light:**
light speed is contant in the universe so many things are derived using it.   

**SI(internation System):**      
Used in every country except liberia,mynmar,united states.they use what is called a imperial system,that has derived units of metric system.   

**The major units are(called Base Units)**
1. **metre**    
2. **kilogram**   
3. **second**   
4. **ampere**   
5. **kelvin**   
6. **candela**   
7. **mole**   

all other units are **derivatives** of this units.   
All Si units are multiple/dividers of 10,so they follow this chart regardless of unit.These are used as prefixes for units.

**Area:Meter<sup>2</sup>**:   
Unit of area is Meter * Meter = Meter<sup>2</sup>.
4 meters squared has side of 4 meters on each side which results in 16 square meters.
**Volume:Meter<sup>3</sup>**:   
unit of volume is cubic meter i.e    

  meter * meter * meter = meter<sup>3</sup>
  
  1 litre = 1000 cm<sup>3</sup>=1000 *1/100 *1/100 * 1/100 meter<sup>3</sup>=1000/1,000,000 M<sup>3</sup>=0.001 M<sup>3</sup>  
  1 litre = 10 * 10 * 10 cm<sup>3</sup>

2.**Kilogram Unit of mass**:
unit:KiloGram
mass: This is the amount of matter an object contains,mass is constant accross universe.
Weight:The amont of gravity on a object with mass,weight changes with change in gravity.    
Weight is measued in newtons since it is a force.

Atomic Mass(mass number)=the mass of a atom,with neutrons and protons combined.
**12 grams of carbon-12 has one mole of atoms.**
The mass of one mole of a substance is its atomic mass grams.
i.e, mass of one mole of gold is atomic weight of gold(196),196 grams of gold.
196 grams of gold = one mole of gold = avogadro's number(6.0221407x10^23) of atoms in it.

4.**Ampere: Unit of Current**

In atom the valence shell(outer most shell),can have free electrons or capability of accepting free electrons.
The materials such as copper,iron have free electrons that can be shared to other copper atoms.These are good for conducting electricity,called conductors.
Materials like glass,rubber,plastic have no free electrons so it can't share electrons.These are good for insulating(protecting humans from contact of electricity)called insulators.
A wire is mostly made of copper that can conduct electricity and a plastic rubber insulator covering on top of it to protect the humans that use it.
In a copper wire the electrons move freely to other copper atoms randomly(without a charge),but when a battery is connected the electrons from battery are pushed(voltage),the electrons in the batter move from negative end to positive end.
In this process the electrons in copper wire move in a particular direction,we can place objects like a light buld in this path to use the electrons to generate light.

**Work**:Work is equal to force(1 newton) applied over a distance(1 meter).Energy is the result of Work performed.when work is done energy is transferred in to new system.
* E=F*meter
* Unit = Joule(j)
* 1 joule = 1 Newton-meter


**power**:Power(P) is the energy divided by unit time.
* P = E / T
* Unit = Watt(W)=J/S

**charge**(q) :physical property of matter(electrons,protons,neutrons)
electron = -1e
proton=+1e
* one coulomb(C) is the charge found in 6.24 * 10<sup>18</sup> \[e\]electrons(or)protons
* 1 electron charge(e) = -1.6 * 10 <sup>-19</sup> Coulombs
* Unit=coulomb(C)
* q = C
  
**current**(I):Flow of charge,a coulomb of electrons passed through a wire in a second is one amp.
* I = q / t 
* unit = Ampere(A)
* 1 Amp = C/s
**Voltage(V)**:voltage is the work needed to move a charge from one point to another.
ex:like a dam on high point to village in low point.
conside a electron and proton with 1 C charge, and 10J of work is done to push them a meter apart,
then the system has 
volt=10j/1c=10Volts of voltage.
* unit = Volt(v),volt is energy passed in joules per unit charge(q or C).
* V = J / C
**electricity**(P):Electricity is power generated through electrical means.It is the product of Voltage(V) and Current(I)
P = V * I
unit = Watt(W)=VQ/t


















**Amp:** **current**(charge) is the flow of electrons,measure in amps. 
1 amp = 1 coulomb/second
1 coulomb = 6,242 * 10<sup>15</sup> electrons(group of electrons)
**Voltage(V):**Voltage is the **pressure** at which the source pushed electrons,
more voltage = more pressure,
more pressure = more electron flow.
Volt = joule/coulomb
a 9 volt battery can do 9 joules of work per 1 coloumb

**Ohm:****Resistance** is the restriction/opposition of flow of electrons in a circuit measured in ohms.
depends on the size,material,temperature.    

| type        | sub-type        | resistance |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| size        | length(more)    | more       |
|             | lenght(less)    | less       |
|             | Thickness(more) | less       |
|             | Thickness(less) | more       |
| material    | conductor       | less       |
|             | insulator       | more       |
| Temperature | less            | less       |
|             | more            | more       |

Resistors are used in circuits to protect components by reducing current flow.

**Inductors:**Current passing through a coil will generate a magnetice field.
wrapping the coil around a iron core will increase the magnetic field.
**Capacitors**:Batteries that store small amount of electrical charge for only a few seconds.

**Energy**:the capacity to do some work is energy.Unit joules.
joule = force(newton)/distance(meter)
force = mass * accleration
accleration = velocity gained/time=V/s
velocity=speed/time=m/s
speed=distance over time(not zero)

Watt: (Electricity)P = I(Amps) x V(Volts)
Kilowatt/hours
milliamp hours
**joules:unit of work**=energy used to create force of one newton across one meter 
W = (F * L) J
